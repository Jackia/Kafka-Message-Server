This Year's Super Clone Rolex's Most Anticipated Watch: Is It the Same?
========================================

When you think of the super clone Rolex GMT watch, the first thing that probably pops into your head is the "red and blue circle." And it’s no wonder—the bright, contrasting colors of the "red and blue circle" have made it a standout since the 1950s, making it a major hit in the world of luxury watches. But there’s also the "red and black circle" which is similar and sometimes confusingly close to the "red and blue circle." This year, the most highly anticipated new product at Geneva’s "Watches and Wonders" is the true "Coca-Cola" circle—the "red and black circle" is making a comeback.

"Pepsi" vs. "Coke"

The "red and blue circle" is nicknamed "Pepsi" because its colors are similar to the Pepsi brand logo. The "red and black circle" is known as the "Coca-Cola circle" due to its resemblance to Coca-Cola’s packaging colors. Since the 21st century, Rolex has stopped updating the red and black circles, leaving a gap for the original "Coca-Cola circle" models. Some people have even started calling the red and blue circles "Coke circles," though that’s not entirely accurate. With a recent patent document leak, it looks like Rolex might be interested in bringing back this classic color scheme.

To understand the origins of the "red and blue circles" and the "red and black circles," we need to look at the history of the series. The Rolex GMT-Master first appeared in the mid-1950s, when the civil aviation industry was booming and long-distance travel across time zones was becoming common. This created a demand for multi-time zone watches. The original Rolex GMT-Master was designed in collaboration with Pan Am and given to their crew on long-haul flights. The first model, the Ref.6542, featured a two-tone red and blue bezel, innovatively splitting the 24-hour bezel into two sections: red for 6 AM to 6 PM and blue for 6 PM to 6 AM.

In terms of heritage, the red and blue circles have a longer history than the red and black circles and were the original color scheme used in the series. The bezel on the first GMT-Master was made of Bakelite (resin), but in 1959 it was upgraded to anodized aluminum, and the reference number was changed to Ref.1675. For many years, anodized aluminum inserts were standard on GMT models.

Jumping ahead to 1983, Rolex released the GMT-Master II, which had a major upgrade: the hour hand and GMT hand were kept separate, and the Cal.3085 calibre allowed for quick adjustment of the GMT hand in one-hour increments. The first model in this series was the Ref.16760, and it introduced the red and black two-tone bezel—the "Coca-Cola circle."

The GMT-Master II didn’t immediately replace the original GMT-Master. From 1983 to 1999, both generations were sold side-by-side. Rolex even updated the GMT-Master I line in 1988 (five years after GMT-Master II launched) with the Ref.16700, which had a sapphire crystal and later models switched from tritium to Luminova for the luminescent markers on the dial.

Along with continuing the "Pepsi Circle," the Ref.16700 also included the "Coca-Cola Circle," which was unique to the GMT-Master II Ref.16760. Given the high overlap between the two generations, the more advanced second generation eventually replaced the first, and only the GMT-Master II line continued into the new century.

In 2007, Rolex began using ceramics for bezels, appreciated for their gloss, strength, and durability. The 2007 Ref.116710LN featured a black Cerachrom ceramic bezel and earned the nickname "Little Green Needle" for its green GMT hand.

Early Cerachrom bezels were only black due to technical limitations, but the technology improved over time. In 2013, Rolex introduced a blue and black bezel with the Ref.116710BLNR, also known as the "Inter Circle" due to its similarity to the Inter Milan team colors.

Creating two-tone ceramics is much harder than single-color ceramics, which also makes it more expensive and difficult to produce. The early Cerachrom red and blue circles, such as the Ref.116719BLRO, were only available in an 18K white gold case, making the "red and blue circles" a luxury item due to their high price.

In 2018, Rolex introduced the Cerachrom ceramic "red and blue circle" in the steel Ref.126710BLRO. At a fraction of the platinum model’s price, it became a hit quickly. To differentiate the platinum model, Rolex also released a "meteorite-faced" GMT-Master II (Ref.126719BLRO), which stood out with its special material.

So far, the "red and blue circle" has seen growing popularity, while the "red and black circle" has been stuck at the Ref.16710 from the late 80s. With upgrades in movement, material, and strap styles for the GMT-Master II series hitting a plateau, reviving a classic color scheme could tap into nostalgia and continue the series' legacy. Here are three guesses about what the new product might be:

Guess 1: The "red and black circle" could be exclusive to a platinum model. The 2018 Ref.126710BLRO used the red and blue circles, which were once exclusive to the platinum model. While the "meteorite face" has somewhat cemented the platinum model’s status, the "red and black circle" might be reserved for a new platinum edition.

Guess 2: The "red and black circle" might be exclusive to "left-handers." In 2022, Rolex launched a GMT-Master II with the crown and date window at 9 o'clock, featuring a two-tone green and black bezel known as the "Sprite Circle." If Rolex does bring back the "red and black circle," it might first appear in a left-handed model.

Guess 3: The "red and black circle" might replace the "red and blue circle." Unlike the "blue-black circle" and "green-black circle," which were added for variety, the "red and black circle" is a derivative of the "red and blue circle." If Rolex revives the "red and black circle," they might discontinue the current Ref.126710BLRO to refresh the lineup, although it's also possible they’ll offer both color schemes, as seen with the Ref.16710.

Whatever the new products look like, we’ll find out at Geneva in April. The [super clone Rolex watch(https://bushrunningmate.com/)] team will be heading to Switzerland, so stay tuned for our follow-up coverage.
